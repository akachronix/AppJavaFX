```

### Design Patterns Used
- **Template Method Pattern** - `PatientForm` abstract class with concrete implementations
- **Interface Segregation** - `PatientCheckInInterface` for workflow definition
- **Singleton Pattern** - `PatientDataStorage` for centralized data management
- **Observer Pattern** - GUI event handling and state management
- **Command Pattern** - Button actions and workflow step navigation

### Data Flow
1. **Patient Registration** → PatientFormGUI → PatientForm/NewPatient
2. **Check-In Initiation** → CheckInPopup → PatientCheckInGUI
3. **Workflow Execution** → CheckInWorkflow → PatientDataObject
4. **Data Persistence** → PatientDataStorage → JSON-like storage
5. **Navigation** → Main → Various GUI components
